A Sized List Datatype
---------------------

Lets cook up our own `List` data type from scratch:

\begin{code}
data List a = Emp
            | (:+:) a (List a)
              deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
\end{code}

We can write a **measure** that logically represents
the *size*, i.e. number of elements of a `List`:

\begin{code}
{-@ measure size      :: List a -> Int
        size (Emp)        = 0
        size ((:+:) x xs) = 1 + size xs
  @-}

{-@ invariant {v:List a | 0 <= size v} @-}

{-@ type ListNE a = {v:List a | size v > 0} @-}
\end{code}

It will be helpful to have a few abbreviations. First,
lists whose size is equal to `N`

\begin{code}
{-@ type ListN a N  = {v:List a | size v = N} @-}
\end{code}
and then, lists whose size equals that of *another* list `Xs`:

\begin{code}
{-@ type ListX a Xs = {v:List a | size v = size Xs} @-}
\end{code}

(a) Computing the Length of a List
----------------------------------

Write down a *refined* type for `length`:

\begin{code}
length            :: List a -> Int
length Emp        = 0
length (x :+: xs) = 1 + length xs
\end{code}

such that the following type checks:

\begin{code}

\end{code}


(b) Constructing Lists
----------------------

Fill in the implementations of the following functions so that
LiquidHaskell verifies respect the given type signatures:

\begin{code}
empty = Emp

add x xs = x :+: xs

singleton x = x :+: empty
\end{code}

(c) Replicating Values
----------------------

Fill in the code, and update the refinement type specification
for `replicate n x` which should return a `List` `n` copies of
the value `x`:

\begin{code}
replicate n x
  | n == 0    = empty
  | otherwise = x :+: replicate (n - 1) x
\end{code}

When you are done, the following assertion should be verified by LH.

\begin{code}
\end{code}

(d) Map
-------

Fix the specification for `map` such that the assertion in `prop_map`
is verified by LH. (This will require you to first complete part (a) above.)

\begin{code}
map f Emp        = Emp
map f (x :+: xs) = f x :+: map f xs
\end{code}

(e) Fold
--------

Fix the specification for `foldr1` so that the call to `die` is
verified by LH:

\begin{code}
foldr1 op (x :+: xs) = foldr op x xs
foldr1 op Emp        = die "Cannot call foldr1 with empty list"

foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> List a -> b
foldr _  b Emp        = b
foldr op b (x :+: xs) = x `op` foldr op b xs
\end{code}

(f) ZipWith
-----------

Fix the specification of `zipWith` so that LH verifies:

+ The call to `die` inside `zipWith` and
+ The assert inside `prop_zipwith`.

\begin{code}
zipWith _ Emp Emp               = Emp
zipWith f (x :+: xs) (y :+: ys) = f x y :+: zipWith f xs ys
zipWith f _          _          = die  "Bad call to zipWith"
\end{code}

(g) List Concatenation *(Hard?)*
--------------------------------

Fill in the (refinement type) specification and
implementation for the function `concat` such that
when you are done, the assert inside `prop_concat`
is verified by LH. Feel free to write any other code
or specification (types, measures) that you need.

\begin{code}
{-@ measure sizeXs          :: List (List a) -> Int
        sizeXs (Emp)            = 0
        sizeXs ((:+:) xs xss)   = size xs + sizeXs xss
  @-}

concat Emp = Emp
concat (xs :+: Emp) = xs
concat (xs :+: (ys :+: xss)) = concat ((append xs ys) :+: xss)

append :: List a -> List a -> List a
append xs Emp = xs
append Emp ys = ys
append (x :+: xs) ys = x :+: append xs ys

\end{code}

========================================
Map-Reduce
========================================

<div class="hidden">
\begin{code}

expand   :: (a -> List (k, v)) -> List a -> List (k, v)
group    :: (Ord k) => List (k, v) -> M.Map k (List v)
collapse :: (v -> v -> v) -> M.Map k (List v) -> M.Map k v
\end{code}
</div>

The following is a super simplified implementation of
[Map-Reduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce)
using the [Lists](List.lhs) and `Data.Map`.

\begin{code}
mapReduce :: (Ord k) => (a -> List (k, v))
                     -> (v -> v -> v)
                     -> List a
                     -> M.Map k v

mapReduce fm fr xs = kvm
  where
    kvs   = expand      fm xs     -- step 1
    kvsm  = group       kvs       -- step 2
    kvm   = collapse fr kvsm      -- step 3
\end{code}

**The Problem** If you solved `foldr1` then you should
get a single type error below, in the call to `foldr1`
in `collapse`. Fix the error by **modifying the
refinement type specifications** only (do not modify any code).

**Note:** This problem requires you to have solved the
`foldr1` problem from [List.lhs](List.lhs); otherwise
no points.

Next, we briefly describe and show each step of the
`mapReduce` function.

Step 1: Map Elements into Key-Value Lists
-----------------------------------------

\begin{code}
expand f xs = concat (map f xs)
\end{code}

Step 2: Group By Key
--------------------

\begin{code}
group     = foldr addKV  M.empty

addKV (k,v) m = M.insert k vs' m
  where
    vs'       = add v (M.findWithDefault empty k m)
\end{code}

Step 3: Reduce Each Key to Single Value
---------------------------------------

\begin{code}
collapse f = M.map (foldr1 f)

toList :: M.Map k v -> List (k, v)
toList = M.foldrWithKey (\k v acc -> add (k, v) acc) empty
\end{code}

\begin{code}
centroid :: Int -> Point -> Int -> Point
distance :: Int -> Point -> Point -> Double
nearest   :: Int -> Int -> Centering -> Point -> Center
mergeCluster :: Int -> Cluster -> Cluster -> Cluster
kmeans1   :: Int -> Int -> List Point -> Centering -> Centering
\end{code}
</div>

Next, lets use our `MapReduce` library to implement
[K-Means Clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)


From Assert.lhs:

Divide By Zero
--------------

Finally, lets write a *safe* divide by zero operator (that we will use later)

\begin{code}
divide :: Double -> Int -> Double
divide n 0 = die "oops divide by zero"
divide n d = n / (fromIntegral d)
\end{code}

Points and Clusters
-------------------

First, lets define the various types that model the key entities in clustering.


\begin{code}
-- | N-Dimensional Point
type Point   = List Double

{-@ type PointN N = ListN Double N @-}
\end{code}

**A Center** is a number between `0` and `k` (written `CenterK k`).

\begin{code}
type Center  = Int
{-@ type CenterK K = {v:Int | 0 <= v && v < K} @-}
\end{code}

**A Centering** is a map from `Center`s to `Point`s. Our clustering algorithm
will aim to group a (large) set of `Point`s into `k` representatives. Thus, a
*k-n-Centering* is a map from `CenterK k` to `PointN n`:

\begin{code}
type Centering = M.Map Center Point
{-@ type CenteringKN K N = M.Map (CenterK K) (PointN N) @-}
\end{code}

**A Cluster** is a pair of a *number* of points (denoting the cluster size)
and the *co-ordinates* denoting the (sum of) the co-ordinates of all the points
in the cluster. We represent `n`-dimensional clusters as `ClusterN n`;  note that
the cluster size is *strictly positive* as we will never represent empty clusters.

\begin{code}
type Cluster = (Int, Point)

{-@ type ClusterN N = (Pos, PointN N) @-}
{-@ type Pos        = {v:Int | v > 0} @-}
\end{code}

(a) Computing Euclidean Distance
--------------------------------

If you did the `zipWith` problem, then you should see an error in
the implementation of `distance` which computes the
[Euclidean Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)
between two points. Fix the **specification** (not the code) of `distance` so
that the code is verified by LH:

\begin{code}
distance n px py = sqrt $ foldr (+) 0 $ zipWith (\x y -> (x-y)^2) px py
\end{code}


(b) Map Points To Nearest Center
--------------------------------

Use `distance` to fill in the **implementation** of `nearest`
so that LH verifies the given type signature.

\begin{code}
nearest k n centers p = pSol
  where
    keyList = M.toList centers
    f x1 x2 = compare (distance n (snd x1) p) (distance n (snd x2) p)
    pSol    = minKeyFuncList keyList f

minKeyFuncList :: (Ord v) => [(k,v)] -> ((k,v) -> (k,v) -> Ordering) -> k
minKeyFuncList xs f = fst $ minimumBy f xs
\end{code}

You may want to use the helper `minKeyMap` that computes the key
with the smallest value in a `Map`:

\begin{code}
--- >>> minKeyMap (M.fromList [(0, 12), (1, 23), (2, 7), (3,18)])
--- 2
minKeyMap  :: (Ord v) => M.Map k v -> k
minKeyMap  = minKeyList . M.toList

minKeyList    :: (Ord v) => [(k,v)] -> k
minKeyList xs = fst $ minimumBy (\x1 x2 -> compare (snd x1) (snd x2)) xs
\end{code}

When you are done, you should get the following behavior:


\begin{code}
-- >>> test_nearest
-- 1
-- test_nearest = nearest 3 2 (M.fromList [(0, p0), (1, p1), (2, p2)]) p
--   where
--     p, p0, p1, p2 :: Point
--     p0 = add 0.0 (add 0.0 empty)
--     p1 = add 3.0 (add 0.0 empty)
--     p2 = add 0.0 (add 3.0 empty)
--     p  = add 2.9 (add 1.1 empty)
\end{code}

(c) Reduce Clusters
-------------------

Fix the **specification** below so that that LH verifies `mergeCluster`
which takes two `Cluster` and merges them by adding up their points
and centers. (Leave the code unmodified).

\begin{code}
mergeCluster n (n1, p1) (n2, p2) = (n1 + n2, zipWith (+) p1 p2)
\end{code}

**Note:** The code above uses `zipWith`; so you will only see the error
and be able to fix it, *after* you solve that problem.

(d) Convert Cluster into Centroid Point
---------------------------------------

The `centroid` function converts a `Cluster` into a single `Point` by
dividing each co-ordinate with the cluster size. Fix the **specification**
of `centroid` so that LH verifies the call to `divide`:

\begin{code}
centroid n p sz = map (\x -> x `divide` sz) p
\end{code}

**Note:** The code below uses `map` from `List.lhs`; and hence
your solution will only work if you solved that problem first.

(e) Iterative Clustering
--------------------

The Kmeans clustering algorithm is shown below:


In essence we start with an initial `k` centering, and repeatedly update it by calling
`kmeans1` which takes as input a list of `n` dimensional points, a centering and returns
a new centering (with `k` centers and `n` dimensional points). The new centers are computed by:

1. Mapping each point to its `nearest` center,
2. Grouping all the points mapped to a center into a new cluster,
3. Reducing the clusters by adding up all the points inside them, and
4. Normalizing each cluster to its `centroid`.

\begin{code}
{-@ kmeans1 :: k:Nat -> n:Nat ->
              List (PointN n) -> CenteringKN k n -> CenteringKN k n
 @-}
kmeans1 k n ps cs = normalize newClusters
  where
    normalize     :: M.Map a Cluster -> M.Map a Point
    normalize     = M.map (\(sz, p) -> centroid n p sz)
    newClusters   = mapReduce fm fr ps
    fm p          = singleton (nearest k n cs p, (1 :: Int, p))
    fr wp1 wp2    = mergeCluster n wp1 wp2
\end{code}

Fix the code and specifications above so that LH verifies the the specification for `kmeans` and `kmeans1`
(i.e. verifies this entire module.)

**Hint:** If you did the above problems correctly, you should have to do nothing here.
Otherwise, think about what type `normalize` should have and try to work backwards
to verify that type.
